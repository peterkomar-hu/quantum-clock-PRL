  abstract = {We study the optomechanical coupling of a oscillating effective mirror
	with a Rydberg atomic gas, mediated by the dynamical atom-mirror
	Casimir-Polder force. This coupling may produce a near-field resonant
	atomic excitation whose probability scales as \$\backslash propto
	(d\^{}2\backslash;a\backslash;n\^{}4\backslash;t)\^{}2/z\_0\^{}8\$,
	where \$z\_0\$ is the average atom-surface distance, \$d\$ the atomic
	dipole moment, \$a\$ the mirror's effective oscillation amplitude,
	\$n\$ the initial principal quantum number, and \$t\$ the time. We
	propose an experimental configuration to realize this system with
	a cold atom gas trapped at a distance \$\backslash sim 2\backslash
	cdot10 \backslash, \backslash mu\$m from a semiconductor substrate,
	whose dielectric constant is periodically driven by an external laser
	pulse, hence realizing en effective mechanical mirror motion due
	to the periodic change of the substrate from transparent to reflecting.
	For a parabolic gas shape, this effect is predicted to excite about
	\$\backslash sim 10\^{}2\$ atoms of a dilute gas of \$10\^{}3\$ trapped
	Rydberg atoms with \$n=75\$ after about \$0.5 \backslash,\backslash

	Photonic channels appear to be very attractive for the physical implementation

	dispersive coupling of light to strongly interacting atoms in highly

  abstract = {Controlled phase (CPHASE) gates can in principle be realized with

	the ultra-high fidelities required for quantum computation with such

	in pulse amplitudes and timings, as well as by stray fields that
	cause fluctuations of the Rydberg levels. We report here a comparative
	study of analytic and numerical pulse sequences for the Rydberg CPHASE
	gate that specifically examines the robustness of the gate fidelity
	with respect to such experimental perturbations. Analytical pulse
	sequences of both simultaneous and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage
	(STIRAP) are found to be at best moderately robust under these perturbations.
	In contrast, optimal control theory is seen to allow generation of
	numerical pulses that are inherently robust within a predefined tolerance
	window. The resulting numerical pulse shapes display simple modulation
	patterns and their spectra contain only one additional frequency
	beyond the basic resonant Rydberg gate frequencies. Pulses of such

	ultra-low-loss filters to eliminate the pump light and separate signal

	source. To detect the photons, we used single-photon detectors based
	on frequency up-conversion. These detectors operated in a non-gated
	mode so that we could use a pulse stream of time correlated entangled
	photon pairs at a high repetition frequency (1 GHz). Using these
	elements, we distributed time-bin entangled photon pairs over 100
	km of dispersion shifted fiber and performed a two-photon interference
	experiment. We obtained a coincidence fringe of 81.6\% visibility
	without subtracting any background noise, such as accidental coincidence

  abstract = {We describe and analyze an efficient register-based hybrid quantum
	computation scheme. Our scheme is based on probabilistic, heralded
	optical connection among local five-qubit quantum registers. We assume
	high fidelity local unitary operations within each register, but
	the error probability for initialization, measurement, and entanglement
	generation can be very high (\~{}5\%). We demonstrate that with a
	reasonable time overhead our scheme can achieve deterministic non-local
	coupling gates between arbitrary two registers with very high fidelity,
	limited only by the imperfections from the local unitary operation.
	We estimate the clock cycle and the effective error probability for
	implementation of quantum registers with ion-traps or nitrogen-vacancy
	(NV) centers. Our new scheme capitalizes on a new efficient two-level
	pumping scheme that in principle can create Bell pairs with arbitrarily
	high fidelity. We introduce a Markov chain model to study the stochastic
	process of entanglement pumping and map it to a deterministic process.
	Finally we discuss requirements for achieving fault-tolerant operation
	with our register-based hybrid scheme, and also present an alternative
	approach to fault-tolerant preparation of GHZ states.},

	allows, for certain classes of problems, exponential speedups over
	classical computation. Various models of quantum computation exist,
	such as the adiabatic, circuit and measurement-based models. They
	have been proven equivalent in their computational power, but operate
	very differently. As such, they may be suitable for realization in
	different physical systems, and also offer different perspectives
	on open questions such as the precise origin of the quantum speedup.
	Here, we give an introduction to the one-way quantum computer, a
	scheme of measurement-based quantum computation. In this model, the
	computation is driven by local measurements on a carefully chosen,
	highly entangled state. We discuss various aspects of this computational
	scheme, such as the role of entanglement and quantum correlations.
	We also give examples for ground states of simple Hamiltonians which
